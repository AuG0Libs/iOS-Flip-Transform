iOS-Flip-Transform

-----

Summary:
Animation component for the effect of flipping as in a news/clock ticker, or a page turn. 

-----
Structured around the idea of a data object (i.e. headline in news, number in a clock, page in a book) as an animation frame, comprised of multiple CALayers.

Supports 3 interaction modes:
Triggered - as in a tap to flip
Auto - as in a revolving flip that loops through data
Controlled - as in a pan gesture that moves the flip layer according to touch

Supports different types of content:
Blank, with background color
With image (whether from file or screenshot)
With dynamic text, either composited on background or on image

Supports customizable parameters:
Sensitivity, gravity, shadow, text positioning, alignment, font etc.

Basic Usage:

1. Create delegate object - 
AnimationDelegate *animationDelegate = [[AnimationDelegate alloc] initWithSequenceType:kSequenceAuto directionType:kDirectionForward];

2. Create flip view and assign it to animation delegate - 
FlipView *flipView = [[FlipView alloc] initWithAnimationType:kAnimationFlipVertical
                                          animationDelegate:animationDelegate
                                                      frame:CGRectMake(60, 95, 200, 50)];
animationDelegate.transformView = flipView;

3. Add flip view as subview and customize properties

4. Call [flipView printText: usingImage: backgroundColor: textColor:] to draw each frame (minimum of 2)

5. Call [animationDelegate startAnimation:] to start the animation. For using buttons or pan gesture, look at the animation controller example
